<h2>osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0</h2>

<p>We are extremely excited and proud to announce the release of osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0! This conquers our largest milestone yet of building a new framework to base our future goals and releases on.</p>

<p>This is our first release that abstracts user features from the core framework to allow customizations to be easily applied, to improve existing and introduce new core framework API features, and by installing and managing Add-Ons for exciting new user features in a flexible and modular manner.</p>

<p>This abstraction no longer limits us to just providing only a shop frontend and a shop backend, but now introduces the opportunity to build entire websites with the framework. Our focus remains on e-commerce and cannot wait to see what the community builds in addition.</p>

<p>osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0 is optimized for and requires PHP 5.3+, supports real database abstraction to support native database server features such as stored procedures, contains a separate namespace to override and perform customizations in, and can easily and securely be upgraded via signed Phar update packages.</p>

<p>Our focus on this release is to stabilize and freeze the framework API and to start building on user features with the community. It does not contain a complete base feature set to start running an online shop on. We are continuing to work hard on completing the base feature set and will push out each completed feature as an update package during April.</p>

<p>osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0 is now completely released under the BSD license to help drive innovation in the open and commercial markets.</p>

<p>We welcome you to explore the new possibilities of osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0 and to participate in its development to help and improve the core framework and introduce exciting new user features. Our future goals and roadmap are published at:</p>
