<h3>Using FTP to Copy the Download Package Contents to the Web Server</h3>

<p>The download package of osCommerce Online Merchant should be saved and extracted on your computer to reveal its contents.. The <em>catalog</em> directory must be copied to the public HTML directory on the web server. This can be achieved on most FTP clients by simply dragging the <em>catalog</em> directory from your local file browser pane to the remote pane listing the files on your web server.</p>

<h3>Directly Extracting the Download Package on the Web Server</h3>

<p>The download package of osCommerce Online Merchant should be saved and extracted on the web server to reveal its contents. The <em>catalog</em> directory must be copied to the public HTML directory. This can be achieved with the following command:</p>

<h2>File Permissions</h2>

<p>The following files need to be writable by the web server during the installation procedure:</p>

<table class="pretty">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>catalog/includes/configure.php</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>catalog/admin/includes/configure.php</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Please consult with your hosting provider to find out the permission flag to use to allow the web server to have write permissions to files and directories.</p>

<div class="note">The above files must have their web server writable permission removed after the installation procedure has completed successfully. This is described in the Post-Installation Steps page.</div>

<div class="achtung">In some cases a global write permission flag of <em>777</em> can be used but may lead to an insecure installation if not reverted afterwards.</div>

<p>Changing the file and directory permissions can be performed by most FTP clients or directly on the server.</p>

<h3>Using FTP to Change File Permissions</h3>

<p>Most FTP clients are capable of changing file permissions on the server. This is commonly performed by right-clicking on the file or directory and selecting "Properties" or "Attributes" on the context menu.</p>

<p>The file permissions can be changed by allowing all users to read, write, and execute the file, or by manually entering the global readable and writable flag of <em>777</em>.</p>

<h3>Changing File Permissions Directly on the Server</h3>

<p>Changing file permissions directly on the server can be performed with the following command:</p>

<pre>{escape}
chmod 777 /public_html/catalog/includes/configure.php
chmod 777 /public_html/catalog/admin/includes/configure.php
{escape}</pre>
