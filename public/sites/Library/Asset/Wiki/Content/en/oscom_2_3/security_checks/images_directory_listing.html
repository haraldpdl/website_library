<h1>images/ Directory Listing</h1>

<p>The images/ directory contains public assets such as javascript libraries and module files that need to be publicly accessible.</p>

<p>It is important that Directory Listing is disabled for this directory in the web server configration to prevent unauthorized access and snooping of the contents in the directory.</p>

<p>After applying the following configuration, confirm the change by accessing the images/ directory with your browser. If you receive a Forbidden 403 error page, the configuration was applied successfully. If you receive an Internal Server 500 error page, undo the changes performed and contact your hosting provider or visit <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/support" target="_blank">our support page</a> for further help.</p>
