<h1>MySQL UTF-8</h1>

<p>The MySQL database tables should have a character set of UTF8 and a collation of utf8_unicode_ci to support encodings of special characters used in languages.</p>

<p>The list of character sets currently used in the database tables can be seen in the Administration Tool -&gt; Tools -&gt; Database Tables page.</p>

<h2>Administration Tool -&gt; Tools -&gt; Database Tables</h2>

<p>This page shows information on all tables available in the database, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Table name</li>
  <li>Number of rows</li>
  <li>Size</li>
  <li>Engine type</li>
  <li>Collation (character set)</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions can be performed on all or selected tables, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check Tables</li>
  <li>Analyze Tables</li>
  <li>Optimize Tables</li>
  <li>Repair Tables</li>
  <li>Convert to UTF8</li>
</ul>

<p>Tables that do not have a utf8_unicode_ci collation can be converted to UTF-8 by using the Convert to UTF8 action.</p>

<div class="info">
  <strong>Info</strong> When performing actions on database tables, please select a few tables at a time as actions take longer to perform on larger tables.
</div>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong> When converting database tables to UTF-8, MySQL will automatically increase the size of varchar and text fields to ensure existing data is not truncated (eg, text fields will be converted to mediumtext).
</div>

<div class="achtung">
  <strong>Warning</strong> Please be sure to have an up-to-date backup of your database before performing actions on database tables, especially if tables are to be converted to UTF-8.
